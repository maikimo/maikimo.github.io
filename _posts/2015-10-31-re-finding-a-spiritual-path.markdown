Dustin DiPerna in _[Streams of Wisdom: An Advanced Guide to Integral Spiritual Development][ddsw]_, quoting Ken Wilber:

> Today, the spiritual endarkenment that was first set in motion during modernity and then strengthened in postmodernity still casts its shadow over most of the Western world.
> 
> As Wilber points out in _[Integral Spirituality][kwis]_, the first step to correcting the cultural pathology is to understand the development of spiritual intelligence within its historical and socio-political context. ...
> 
> Wilber accounts for the process of what I call the modern endarkenment beautifully:
> 
>> In correctly spotting the immaturity of the notion of a mythic god—or a mythic [traditional] level of the spiritual line—[Western intellectuals] threw out not just the **mythic level** of spiritual intelligence **but the entire line** of spiritual intelligence. So upset were they with the mythic level, they tossed the baby of the spiritual line with the bathwater of its mythic level of development. They jettisoned the [traditional] amber God, and instead of finding [modern] orange God, and then [postmodern] green God, and [Integral] turquoise God, and indigo God, they ditched God altogether, they began the repression of the sublime, **the repression of their own higher levels of spiritual intelligence**. The intellectual West has fundamentally never recovered from this cultural disaster. [Wilber’s emphasis]
> 
> Wilber calls this a level/line fallacy. The entire line of spiritual intelligence was erroneously confused and conflated with a particular stage of spiritual growth.

This connects to an earlier striking statement in Dustin's Introduction: 

> Religious traditions are not composed of homogeneous practitioners but rather a complex pool of individuals each of whom rests at a particular structure-stage of development. Each structure-stage enacts a different version of the tradition. As a result, we find that there is not just one version of each tradition, but rather a version of every tradition appropriate for each stage of development. This means that there is a magic version of Christianity, a mythic version, a rational version, a pluralistic version, and an integral version. Just as there is a magic version of Buddhism, a mythic version, a rational version, a pluralistic version and an integral version.

**Notes:**  

* _Line_ = the trajectory of possible development along each of numerous parallel aspects of being human (akin to the idea of "multiple intelligences," e.g., spiritual, emotional, relational, moral, sexual, etc.)  
* _Level_ = _Stage_ ~= _Structure-Stage_ (still working on understanding precision meaning of last term)
